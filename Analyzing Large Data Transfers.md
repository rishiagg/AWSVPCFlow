**Title: Analyzing Large Data Transfers with Internal/External IP Differentiation**

**Description:**
This KQL query aims to analyze large data transfers within a specified time range while differentiating between internal and external IP addresses. The query filters the data from the "AWSVPCFlow" table in Azure Sentinel based on several conditions, including time range, IP address ranges, log status, and transferred bytes. It then projects relevant fields to provide insights into the source and destination IP addresses, whether they are internal or external, and the amount of data transferred.

**Query:**
```kql

AWSVPCFlow
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(24h)
| extend IsSrcAddrInternalIP = case(ipv4_is_in_range(SrcAddr, '10.0.0.0/8') or ipv4_is_in_range(SrcAddr, '172.16.0.0/12') or ipv4_is_in_range(SrcAddr, '192.168.0.0/16'),true,false)
| extend IsDstAddrInternalIP = case(ipv4_is_in_range(DstAddr, '10.0.0.0/8') or ipv4_is_in_range(DstAddr, '172.16.0.0/12') or ipv4_is_in_range(DstAddr, '192.168.0.0/16'),true,false)
| where LogStatus == "OK"
| where Bytes > 100000000
| project SrcAddr, IsSrcAddrInternalIP, DstAddr, IsDstAddrInternalIP, Bytes

```

**Explanation:**
1. The query begins by selecting data from the "AWSVPCFlow" table within the last 24 hours (`TimeGenerated >= ago(24h)`).

2. Two new columns, `IsSrcAddrInternalIP` and `IsDstAddrInternalIP`, are added using the `extend` operator. These columns are assigned boolean values based on whether the source and destination IP addresses fall within the defined internal IP ranges (`10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, and `192.168.0.0/16`).

3. The `where` clause filters the data further by checking the log status, ensuring only records with a log status of "OK" are considered.

4. Another `where` clause filters the data based on transferred bytes, selecting only records where the transferred bytes exceed 100,000,000 (100MB).

5. Finally, the `project` operator is used to project the source address (`SrcAddr`), internal/external flag for the source address (`IsSrcAddrInternalIP`), destination address (`DstAddr`), internal/external flag for the destination address (`IsDstAddrInternalIP`), and the number of bytes transferred (`Bytes`).

By executing this query, you can gain insights into large data transfers, differentiate between internal and external IP addresses, and identify potential security risks or anomalies within your network.
